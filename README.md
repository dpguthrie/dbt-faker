# dbt-faker

This is a project used solely to create fake data used for demos

## Why Though?

Old, stale data is not compelling.  It's especially not compelling when trying to demo functionality that shines when you're only looking at fresh data.  This is an attempt to solve this problem.

## To-Do

1. Explain how others can contribute to this project (e.g. how to create an orm, factory, and add to the script).
2. Create a utility that automates the creation of stubbed out orms and factories for specific datasets.
3. Probably some bug fixes
